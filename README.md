# Directed Multigraph Miner (DMGM)
DMGM is a library for data mining in directed multigraphs. 
In a directed graph edges are directed from a source vertex to a target vertex.
In a multigraph there may be multiple edges between any pair of vertices. 
Altough popular graph models such as the property graph model or RDF show these features, 
most existing graph mining libraries lack of their support.
DMGM is Open Source (GPL v3), open for contributions and aims to be a general framework for practical graph mining algorithms.
